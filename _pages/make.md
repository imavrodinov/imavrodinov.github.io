One of my first childhood memories involved me disassembling my dad's electronics, though I don't quite remember if this curiosity of mine always involved putting them back together again.

Twenty something years later, I firmly believe that the act of making something is one of the most profound characteristics of us as a species.

Here's the thing - I like to make stuff. All sorts of stuff! Most of my projects are born as a cool little ideas, hacks and fun gadgets, though I occasionally dab into artsy stuff as well.

A few of the more notable things I've made, in no particular oder:

- secret library door
- renovated a nearly dumped antique elk trophy (I named him George and he lives in my home office now)
- Alexa enabled sound reactive 3D printed art installation (think Venus de Milo, but cheekier)
- several arcade cabinets (Raspberry Pi & junk computer equipment)
- 3D printed geometric chess set (available [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1695394))
- a bunch of automated vivariums for exotic poison dart frogs
- a wearable thing I called [Klikr](http://mavrodinov.me/klikr)
- battery powered electric longboard
- ~~wheel~~ beer of [fortune](http://mavrodinov.me/improving-ux-through-rng/)

A few tools and technologies I currently use:

FDM | Original Prusa MK2 (well over 1500 print hours)
DLP | Anycubic Photon (approaching 200 print hours)
CAD | Fusion360, Blender
Arduino, Raspberry Pi and compatibles | Adafruit and Sparkfun
woodworking, CNC, welding | [Smarfbablab](http://www.smartfablab.org)

A few projects I have on deck:

- I'll be hosting a (very) experimental Arduino workshop in early August (there's still one free slot)
- currently prototyping prosthetic covers for BK amputees in collaboration with a local prosthetic center
- a wearable device that transforms various sensor inputs into sound using bone conduction transducers (Python collaborators wanted)
- IoT organic light fixture made out of molded silicone and epoxy resin
